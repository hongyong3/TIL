## Computational Thinking and Data Science

### Introduction and Optimization Problems



#### How dose it compare to 6.0001?

* Programming assignments a bit easier
  * Focus more on the problem to be solved than on programming
* Lecture content more abstract
* Lectures will be a bit faster-faced
* Less about learning to program, more about dipping your toe into data science



#### Honing Your Programming Skills

* A few additional bits of Python
* Software engineering
* Using packages
* How do you get to Carnegie Hall?



#### Computational Models

* Using computation to help understand the world in which we live
* Experimental devices that us to understand something that has happened or to predict the future
* `Optimization models`
* Statistical models
* Simulation models



#### What is Optimization Model?

* An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized, e.g.,
  * Minimize time spent traveling from New York to Boston
* A set of constraints (possibly empty) that must be honored, e.g.,
  * Cannot spend more than $100
  * Must be in Boston before 5:00PM



#### Knapsack Problem

* You have limited strength, so there is a maximum weight knapsack that you can carry
* You would like to take more stuff than you can carry
* How do you choose which stuff to take and which to leave behind?
* Two variants
  * `0/1 knapsack problem`, Formalized
  * Continuous or fractional knapsack problem



####  0 / 1 Knapsack Problem, Formalized

* Each item is represented by a pair, <u>**<value, weight>**</u>

* The knapsack can accommodate items with a total weight of no more than ***w***

* A vector, ***L***, of length *n*, represents the set of available items. Each element of the vector is an item

* A vector, ***V***, of length *n*, is used to indicate whether or not items are taken. if *V[i] = 1*, Il[i]* is taken.

  If V[i] = 0, item *I[i]* is not taken

* Find a V that maximizes

#### Brute Force Algorithm

* 1. Enumerate all possible combinations of items. That is to say, generate all subsets of the set of items. This is called the ***power set***.
* 2. Remove all of the combinations whose total units exceeds the allowed weight.
* 3. From the remaining combinations choose any one whose value is the largest.



#### Often Not Practical

* How big is power set?
* Recall
  * A vector, ***V***, of length *n*, is used to indicate whether or not items are taken. If *V[i] = 1*, item *I[i]* is taken. If *V[i] = 0*, item *I[i]* is not taken
* How many possible different  values can V have?
  * As many different binary numbers as can be represented in *n* bits
* For example, if there are 100 items to choose from, the power set is of size?
  * 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376



#### Are We Just Being Stupid?

* Alas, no
* 0/1 knapsack problem is inherently exponential
* But don't despair



#### Greedy Algorithm a Practical Alternative

* while knapsack not full put "best" available item in knapsack
* But what does best mean?
  * Most valuable
  * Least expensive
  * Highest value / units
